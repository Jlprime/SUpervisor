# SUpervisor
Optimises your NUS CAP by providing you your top three best S/U options.

## Usage Instructions
I haven't made the GUI for this program yet. This is just a bare-bones, command-line script that can optimise your CAP if you are too demoralized to evaluate your S/U options manually. 
After all, who does anything manually these few days?

Download `main.py` and run it on your Terminal or Command Prompt by entering the command `python3 main.py`. Follow the instructions carefully - I have not added input validation just yet, so any 
wrong input will crash this entire program. If you followed these instructions successfully, you will be presented with all the possible combinations of modules you can S/U for this semester, and 
how each combination will affect your CAP.

Enjoy, and don't be too demoralized about your CAP, yeah? Life is short.

## Disclaimer
Nobody has tested this program out yet. I cannot guarantee this program's accuracy, as it was coded in one day based on my limited understanding of the GPA and S/U system of NUS.
Also it was coded out of desperation because I am way too lazy to evaluate my S/U options manually, but I know that if I don't at least put in some effort to find out what my options are,
I will eventually feel bad. Can relate? Lets go out and have a drink someday and talk about it.

If anybody is willing to read my code and finds a logical flaw, please let me know. I will be very happy and will give you a follow on your GitHub and give you free CS2030 tuition.
